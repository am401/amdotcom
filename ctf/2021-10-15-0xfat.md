[0xf.at](http://0xf.at) is a hackit style password-riddle site. The [GitHub Project](https://github.com/HaschekSolutions/0xf.at) has setup instructions to configure it locally using Docker. The framework also allows a user to create their own levels and add them to the overall project.

The challenges primarily take up a similar format, some challenge notes along with an input box to provide the answer in. At the time of writing all the solitions have been in the page's source code.

## Level 1
### Challenge notes

{:.blockquote-style}
Easy beginnings

{% highlight html %}
<!-- :::::::::::::::::==== GAME STARTS HERE ====::::::::::::::::: -->
    <h1>Level 1</h1>
    <div>Easy beginnings</div>
    <input id="pw" type="password" />
    <br/><input type="button" value="OK" onClick="checkPW()"/>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function checkPW()
        {
            var el = document.getElementById('pw');
            if(el.value=="tooeasy")
                document.location.href="?pw="+el.value;
            else alert("Wrong password!");
        }
    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

The above is pretty straight forward. The `if` statement checks whether the value of the `el` variable is a certain string and verifies whether it's the password.

            else alert("Wrong password");
        }
    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

In this scenario it looks like we are given the password as a variable (`pw`) and checking the `if` statement, we are having to unescape it. A method to do this would be to fire up the browser's Console window and go through the steps:

{% highlight javascript %}
var pw = "%39%32%31%61%61";
unescape(pw)
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}

This challenge tried to trick us as if there was no source code. Instead we had to scroll down around 4400 lines to the bottom. The challenge itself is similar as before. We are this time putting together the password from a few different elements:

{% highlight javascript %}
if(el.value==unescape("r%20i%20g%20h%20t%20")+""+"p"+"w"+""+"6943ad11f")
{% endhighlight %}

We first want to figure out the value of the `unescape("r%20i%20g%20h%20t%20")` element:

After that there was a bit of a trick by adding two empty strings to the pattern: `+""+` adds nothing and can in a sense be ingored.

    <h1>Level 4</h1>
    <div>What does .length mean?</div>
    <input id="pw" type="password" />
    <br/><input type="button" value="OK" onClick="checkPW()"/>
     <script type="text/javascript">
        function checkPW()
        {
            var el = document.getElementById("pw");
            var pwinfo = "3523 f1b04eb e2ddc14 f50 fe 1135d3a55400c503ae  1120c 51404eba50a5b45ea3d";

            else alert("Wrong password");
        }
    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

Analyzing the code, we are presented with a variable, `var pwinfo = "3523 f1b04eb e2ddc14 f50 fe 1135d3a55400c503ae  1120c 51404eba50a5b45ea3d";`. Looking at `if` statement that checks the input validity, the password matches the length of this variable. We can again solve this using the Browser Console.

Have you heard of ASCII?

<!-- :::::::::::::::::==== GAME STARTS HERE ====::::::::::::::::: -->
    <h1>Level 5</h1>
    <div>Have you heard of ASCII?</div>
    <input id="pw" type="password" />
    <br/><input type="button" value="OK" onClick="checkPW()"/>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function checkPW()
        {
            var el = document.getElementById("pw");
            if(el.value==(atoi("o")+73))
                window.location.href="?pw="+el.value;
            else alert("Falsches Passwort");
        }

        // converts a character to its ASCII number
        function atoi(a)
        {
           return a.charCodeAt();
        }
    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that the input value is compared to the following: `(atoi("o")+73)`. Further along in the code, we see a function called `atoi` which takes the argument `a`. The function returns the `charCodeAt()` JavaScript method, which in a nutshell gives us the unicode value of a string. Additional information and context can be found on the [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_charcodeat.asp) website.

We can rely on our trusty Console to solve this challenge again, pasting in the `atoi()` function and calling it to find the value of the letter **o**.

            if(el.value==rgb2hex(document.getElementById("though").style.color))
                window.location.href="?pw="+escape(el.value);
            else window.location.href="?pw="+escape(el.value);
        }

        function rgb2hex(rgb) {
            rgb = rgb.match(/^rgb\((\d+),\s*(\d+),\s*(\d+)\)$/);
            function hex(x) {
                return ("0" + parseInt(x).toString(16)).slice(-2);
            }
            return "#" + hex(rgb[1]) + hex(rgb[2]) + hex(rgb[3]);
        }

{% endhighlight %}

For this challenge I included a screenshot of the challenge notes as this will be key. The source code has two functions in there. `checkPW()`, which will verify our input is correct as well as `rgb2hex()` which takes the argument `rgb`. This function essentially returns a hex string generated from the RGB colors of our input.

Looking at the `checkPW()` function, the `if` statement is gathering the word from the page "though", which on our screenshot is green (`rgb(153, 255, 51)`). The check also gathers the color style that the word is using. Our trusty Console helps us out to get the answer.

    <p>Let's think this through</p>
    <input id="pw" type="password" />
    <br/><input type="button" value="OK" onClick="checkPW()"/>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function checkPW()
        {
            var foo = 5 + 6 * 7;
            var bar = foo % 8; //modulo.. look it up if you don't know what it does
            var moo = bar + 1;
            var rar = moo / 3;
            var el = document.getElementById("pw");
            if(el.value.length == moo)
                window.location.href="?pw="+el.value;
            else alert("Wrong password");
        }
    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

This is a pretty straight forward challenge, however as the notes suggest we just need to think it through. The first part is solving the equations. There is a little trick in there, since we have four variables: `foo`, `bar`, `moo` and `rar`, however as we can see within the challenge password verifying `if` statement, we actually need the value of `moo`.

We can step through these easily using the console:

{% highlight javascript %}
var foo = 5 + 6 * 7;
var bar = foo % 8;
var moo = bar + 1;
moo;
8
{% endhighlight %}

We now know that the value of the `moo` variable is **8**. The verification step checks whether our input's lenght is equal to the value of the `moo` variable: ` if(el.value.length == moo)`. Since it's checking the length of the input, we can use any string that matches the length criteria.

            var el = document.getElementById("pw");

        }

    </script>
<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

This one is more of a tricky one than a complicated challenge. Within the `checkPW()` function we are given a variable `"+CodeCode+"` and further along in the code, when checking if the input value matches our password, we can see the comparison: `if(el.value == ""+CodeCode+"")`.

One might be fooled into thinking we are trying to compare to the value of the `"+CodeCode+"` variable, however if we take a look at the behavior, we are actually searching for the variable `CodeCode`. The `""` add an empty string and the `+` in this case works to concatenate the empty strings with the word `CodeCode`. Searching the code, outside of the `checkPW()` function we can find this variable.

<!-- ::::::::::::::::::==== GAME ENDS HERE ====:::::::::::::::::: -->
{% endhighlight %}

For this challenge we are asked to calculate the sum of all numbers between **1** and **477**. A friend of mine and I came up with a solution each when solving this challenge.

### Solution 1
I went down the route of a loop to calculate the sum, whereby `i` is our sum and `x` is our iterator, which tracks where in the loop we are as well as adding the value of that number to `i`:

{% highlight python %}
>>> i = 0
>>> x = 1
>>> while x < 478:
...     i += x
...     x += 1
{% endhighlight %}

To get the flag, we just need to print the value of `i`.
### Solution 2
On a similar note, my friend used Python along with the mathematical formula for the [sum of the first n natural numbers](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/tatami/kumo/exs/sum/):

{% highlight python %}
{% raw %}
python -c "n=477; print((n*(n+1))/2)"
{% endraw %}

This is another challenge where it's more about being able to read the code and think logically. The PHP function we are given essentially checks that the length of the `$username` is equal to the variable `$password`. From this, we know that the function will take a username, calculate its length and check if the entered password is equal to that length.

For this challenge we are given another snippet of PHP. We can see from the `$users` variable, that the information is gathered from a file found at `/data/login_info.json`. The [implode()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.implode.php) function is a bit of a red-herring here as it's not exactly joining array elements beyond printing out the file.

From the rest of the code, we can see that it's looking for the `account_status` to be `active`. When we look at the file, only one user is active and the user data holds the necessary pieces to the flag.

On this challenge we are given a string, which is meant to be encoded - `npveei`. We are then provided with two input boxes, one to provide arbitary data to encrypt using the same method `npveei` was generated with and the other to submit our password.

Testing the encryption with `abcdef` we can start to observe a behavior. The encrypted version of the string is `acegik`. From this it looks like each character is shifted by its position:

{% highlight html %}
Position 1 - a => a
Position 2 - b => c
Position 3 - c => e
Position 4 - d => g
Position 5 - e => i
Position 6 - f => k
{% endhighlight %}

We can use this knowledge to reverse engineer our encrypted string. While this can be done programmatically, I found it quicker to solve it by pulling up the [English alphabet](http://civilfastforward.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1.-Letters-table.png) in a numbered chart and calculated it.

This was an overall very straight forward challenge. The password we enter into the input box gets Base64 encoded (`base64_encode($password)`)and is matched against a fixed value (`ODNhMjNmYjU4MmUxMDU5ODhkMjI2YmVjMw==`). To complete this challenge, we can decode this value.

On this challenge we are presented with a string, which appears to be morse code. I tried a variety of morsecode converters, however for whatever reason they did not work on this string. Much like **Level 15**, I opted to manually convert the values using this [International Morse Code sheet](https://www.boxentriq.com/img/morse-code/morse-code-overview.png).

I was able to manually convert the values within the provided *60 seconds*. For the above example the flag was:

This was a bit more challenging. We are given a keypad and instructions to convert the characters on the keypad to numbers. We are only given 15 seconds to solve this and the string given is 32 characters long, therefore we have to look at this programmatically. I used Python to build out a dictionary where I calculated the sum of each character. The script than takes the string we are given to calculate the sum of and creates a list of its characters.

We can then iteratre through the list of characters and match them against the dictionary keys to get the sum (value) of it. If the character is not in our dictionary, we can assume it's a number and we can use the number to add to the sum.

{% highlight python %}
import sys

char_sums = {'a': '4', 'b': '6', 'c': '8', 'd': '6', 'e': '9', 'f': '12', 'g': '8', 'h': '12', 'i': '16', 'j': '10', 'k': '15', 'l': '20', 'm': '12', 'n': '18', 'o': '24', 'p': '14', 'q': '21', 'r': '28', 's': '35', 't': '16', 'u': '24', 'v': '32', 'w': '18', 'x': '27', 'y': '36', 'z': '45'}

input = sys.argv[1]
char = list(input)
sum = 0
for c in char:
    if c in char_sums.keys():
        sum += int(char_sums.get(c))
    else:
        sum += int(c)
print(sum)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the above script and supplying the string provided by the challenge gets us the flag.

## Level 20
### Challege notes

{:.blockquote-style}
The password of this level is an MD5 encrypted string which was calculated by combining two random words (without spaces) from >>this wordlist<< (144kb).
Can you find out which two words were used?

{% highlight html %}
94038af05987a8f39820992dbc2d7fea
{% endhighlight %}

At this stage the challenges are becoming more and more reliant on programming. This challenge has us download a word list that contains **68847** words. Two random words are taken and their **MD5** hash is generated. To solve the challenge, we are asked to find the two random words that were encrypted.

I decided to use Python to figure this out. On an initial research, I found an [article](https://www.md5online.org/blog/decrypt-md5-python/). We can use the `hashlib` to encrypt our combined words to get their MD5 hash. We can then run through the list combining the words from our wordlist, calculate their MD5 hash and compare if this matches the one we are provided.

I am personally not familiar with threading, therefore my script is relatively slow in that respect and this could be considerably sped up with multi-threading, however that wasn't my aim. Another option is GoLang is meant to have decent multi-threading capabilities.

I essentially came up with two ideas and it was the second idea that worked but either is an option. One thing to consider, I use the `0xf.at` **Docker** container and each time the container is restarted, a new hash is generated.

### Solution one
The first solution is to create an application that will run through the word list, combining the two wods and compare the generated hash to the one `0xf.at` provided. The script can then alert us to which two words successfully matched the hash.

{% highlight python %}
import hashlib
import sys

def open_file():
    with open('wordlist.txt', 'r') as f:
        words = f.read().splitlines()
    return words

a = open_file()
b = open_file()

for x in a:
    for y in b:
        c = x + y
        calc_hash = hashlib.md5(c.encode())
        hash_val = calc_hash.hexdigest()
        password = "0d5d4abe4a0c61bd3117e895cf90da83"
        print(c)
        if hash_val == password:
            print("The decrypted value is: " + c)
            sys.exit()
{% endhighlight %}

### Solution two
The second idea is to create a [Rainbow Table](https://project-rainbowcrack.com/table.htm), which is essentially a pre-compiled table of cryptographic hashes and their plaintext value that can be searched. The idea still works the same, create a table with the combined words and their MD5 hash and once done, search through it for the given hash.

I ran into some limitations with this one. I built the script out on my RaspberryPi and left it running overnight in a `screen`. By the morning my rainbow table was sitting at **45GB** with *939,645,348* lines generated. The first record being `aaaa: 74b87337454200d4d33f80c4663dc5e5` and the table only getting to `bucktoothbanquets: 93e073c8fb9fd8439fe9bcc28d4b6b41`.

This script essentially saves the result of the combined words and their hash to a file.

{% highlight python %}
import hashlib
import sys

def open_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        words = f.read().splitlines()
    return words

def save_file(filename,result):
    with open (filename, "a+") as file:
        file.write(result)

a = open_file('wordlist.txt')
b = open_file('wordlist.txt')

for x in a:
    for y in b:
        c = x + y
        calc_hash = hashlib.md5(c.encode())
        hash_val = calc_hash.hexdigest()

        result = "\n" + c + ": " + hash_val
        save_file('rainbowtable.txt', result)
{% endhighlight %}

I ended up rebooting my `Docker` container running `0xf.at` and searching through the existing table, I was able to find the result.

I approached Python again to automate out this task. We are again given a wordlist to download and instructions to solve the channel. In this case we are given a string of jumbled words separated by semicolons. When unscrambled, these words match words within the provided word list.

I went through a lot of variations of this script. I first tried to generate each possible combination of a word and compare it to existing words in the list, however this was taking forever.

I then tried to get the length of the longest and shortest words in the provided string and filter out words that did not meet the criteria when reading in the word list, however in the end this removed roughly 3000 words of again **68847** words.

I tried permutating functions, libraries and such but again was taking forever. The winning idea was to read in the provided string, split it at the semicolons and break down each word into characters. Using `set()` I could ensure we filtered it down to unique characters and I could then use `sort()` to ensure they were in order. This method was applied to both the word from the provided string and the one from the word list. If the letters matched, the length of the word would be considered to ensure it matched the length of the word from `0xf.at`.

Unfortunately this can mean that multiple words are matched that contain the same number of the same characters so it's currently a few tries before I get a successful string. I'll update this article if I figure out a better way to solve this challenge.

{% highlight python %}
import sys

input_string = sys.argv[1]
input_list = list(input_string.split(';'))

def open_file(filename):

        words = f.read().splitlines()
    return words

def check_words(s,ch):

word_list = open_file('wordlist.txt')

result = []
for i in input_list:

        if check_words(char_list, wordz):

For this challenge we are provided with a random string that we are asked to reverse and supply the combined value of the two as the password. What I found based on the example is the last character of the string is skipped, ie in the above example instead of `...78900987...` we have `...7890987...`.

This just required an additional step to remove the last character from the string before reversing it:
